I am not sure if Chris left that couch for a \"VINTAGE\" look, but it doesn't go with the rest of the Modern-man decor that he had around.  Besides that couch that is old and looked dirty, the rest of the apartment was great, is modern, lot's of light that comes in, I personally love the kitchen and  my friend loved the bathroom because of the two shower heads. The apartment is at a good location.  It's 15 minutes away from downtown, you can get an Uber, Lyft, or Taxi for around $12-15/ride, or if  you will like to experience the \"T\" (train) it was around $2.20/ride; we did both and the \"T\" was as fast as the Uber.  The neighborhood seem safe, but like any city, we only took the \"T\" during the day and at night we Uber our way back. The neighborhood was nice and quite so that was a plus. Chris is a good host, he did answer our questions at a timely manner.  When I was at his apartment, I felt like I was staying at a friend's house.  We had a good stay, so Thank you Chris for opening your doors to our little adventure.</td>\n",

We very much enjoyed the stay and will definitely stay again the next time we return. Alex was a great host too - stopped by to make sure everything was going well.

       "135501  This apartment was a perfect place to come back to (especially after 20hrs of flying) Perfectly located and in walking distance to everything (downtown, space needle, pike market).

       "45729    My friend and I, were very impress when we walked in at the apartment, then there was the old couch towards the window.  In the picture you can not really tell that it's a pretty old couch.  I am not sure if Chris left that couch for a \"VINTAGE\" look, but it doesn't go with the rest of the Modern-man decor that he had around.  Besides that couch that is old and looked dirty, the rest of the apartment was great, is modern, lot's of light that comes in, I personally love the kitchen and  my friend loved the bathroom because of the two shower heads. The apartment is at a good location.  It's 15 minutes away from downtown, you can get an Uber, Lyft, or Taxi for around $12-15/ride, or if  you will like to experience the \"T\" (train) it was around $2.20/ride; we did both and the \"T\" was as fast as the Uber.  The neighborhood seem safe, but like any city, we only took the \"T\" during the day and at night we Uber our way back. The neighborhood was nice and quite so that was a plus.

       "66559   Alex's place was just as described by both Alex and many reviewers - clean, spacious and recently modernized. Very short walk to the T which was only about a 20-min ride into downtown (or 5 min over to Sam Adams Brewery in the other direction). We very much enjoyed the stay and will definitely stay again the next time we return. Alex was a great host too - stopped by to make sure everything was going well. We even took him up on buying his pair of tickets for one night at Fenway - AMAZING seats (do it if you have the chance). Would definitely recommend staying here!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

Will take a small subset of predictions and personally evaluate if sentiment analysis seems reasonable. I am aiming for a minimum viable product that is usable so will also discuss next steps to improve model at the end. Second reason is it will be interesting to see if positivity/negativity of comments correlate with overall review score. I expect it will. Will use R Score to evaluate. "
